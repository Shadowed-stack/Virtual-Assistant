# Virtual-Assistant
This is just for fun but for seriousness just contact me
First run the python setup file
Then extract the executable files.
Go to the executable files folder and execute the files.(Just simply click them.)
But first remember to run the upgrade pip file. But if it doesn't work then run upgrade pip(2) file.
Then run the Friday.py and enjoy.


If you have read this text file clearly and executed it properly then you will be able to run the virtual assistant with ease.
